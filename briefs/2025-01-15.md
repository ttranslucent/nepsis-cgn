# Nepsis Brief — 2025-01-15

## What we accomplished
- Bootstrapped the `nepsis-web` Next.js app with Tailwind and a Nepsis-branded layout plus landing page.
- Implemented passwordless email login (API routes + UI) and added settings/playground flows, including local API-key storage, status indicators, and a side-by-side Nepsis playground experience.
- Wired `/api/run-with-nepsis` from an echo stub to the real OpenAI Responses API, iterating on headers, payload formatting, and response parsing so `gpt-4.1-mini` runs end-to-end.
- Verified each stage with lint/builds, committed, and pushed to `main` for Vercel redeploys.

## What’s next
1. Replace the stubbed CGN result with a real evaluator (e.g., puzzle/UTF-8 manifold).
2. Move API-key persistence server-side (or encrypted storage) to avoid keeping secrets in the browser.
3. Improve UX and auth hardening: richer error states, violation visualizations, and gating the playground for logged-in users.
4. Add provider/key diagnostics so users can validate connectivity before running Nepsis.
